# Cypress Talk in Brighton January 2020

This project is a simple example project that runs with Microsoft B2C security and secured routes
It is written to show aspects of Cypress and how it can mock api calls with substitutes and run as part of a CI build
It integrates with a Azure Devops to automatically build/deploy using a pipeline from GitHub so uses headless chrome througout.
When cypress releases it's firefox headless module the intention is to incorporate that too.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.9.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).
